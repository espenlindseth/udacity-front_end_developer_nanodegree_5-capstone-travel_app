# Trip Planner App

## Overview
This is the capstone for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. It ties together everything from all the previous projects.


## Instructions
To run this, clone it or download the repo, make sure you have node installed. I used v10.15.3.

Run this to install:
```npm install```


Then you should be able to:
Run ```npm run build-prod``` to use webpack to build the prod env.

Run ``` npm start``` to start the express web server.

Navigate to localhost:8081 to browse the web site.
